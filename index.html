    <p><strong>Hey there!</strong> Hello, World!!
    Here is the First Mighty Challenge, A.K.A. <&quot;>Programming Task</&quot;> (you ready?):
Roomies App (like Besties!) <br

60 school-aged children; 31 boys, 29 girls
10 dorm rooms, 4-8 children in each room
Same-sex rooms only!
Kicker: Each child can have a besties list of up to 4 roomates, and everyone is guaranteed at least 1 roommate from his/her besties list
Management needs this app completed, tested and launched by the end of the day!</p>
